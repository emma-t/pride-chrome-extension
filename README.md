# üßê Project challenges

In 24 hours, we have created a Chrome extension that makes users aware of the underrepresented group in tech; LGBTQ+ members.

# üë®‚Äçüíª Tech stack

Here's a brief high-level overview of the tech stack this project uses:

- This project uses CSS, HTML, and JS in terms of the created Chrome Extension popup and for the actual styling changes
- We used VSCode to make changes to our code
- Chrome was essential to see how our hack actually functions.

# ‚úçÔ∏è Contributing
Interested in contributing to the Pride Chrome Extension project? Thanks so much for your interest! We are always looking for improvements to the project and contributions from open-source developers are greatly appreciated.

# üåü Spread the word!

If you want to say thank you and/or support active development of Pride Chrome Extension:
- Add a GitHub Star to the project 
- Support us on the [Hackathon's Devpost](https://all-in-hackathon.devpost.com/)

Thanks so much for your interest in growing the reach of Pride Chrome Extension! LGBTQ+ members are underrepresented in tech as much as they are in the media so it's important to be inclusive in all spaces.

# ‚ö†Ô∏è License
The Pride Chrome Extension is available under the MIT license. See the LICENSE file for more info.
